Initial Game Design:
- A fallen knight who was once loyal to his kingdom has returned to see it in ruins. All that remains in the rubble of the throne room is the Queen's cat who he would always play with. He must uncover the secrets of the castle and what caused it to fall, while being accompanied by the cat which gives him a strange radiant power.

- A janitor that frequently plays his Walkman while working enters his usual mall for work but notices it is very different from what he is used to. Any usual spots he frequents are distorted and "off" with strange supernatural happenings going inside them. He finds mopping the floor allows him to teleport to that spot whenever he wishes.
